David Allen, GTD: "Our brains are for having ideas, not holding them"

Human memory holds four things at once:

**1. Triage:** Takes thoughts from your mind and collects them to decide later, things like calendar events, taska, search, problem.

**2. Processing:** for larger tasks that require breakdown, things like brainstorming, research, making outline, reading a book, tracking some thing.

**3. Action Center:** Prioritize tasks, delegate, schedule a time to execute a task.
