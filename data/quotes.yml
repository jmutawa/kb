    Few things **demoralize** a workforce like a **leader who
    doesn't pick the right-sized goal.** <br /><br />
    If you think it's discouraging to break a promise to yourself,
    imagine multiplying that discouragement by a hunder or even
    a thousand employees.

    The only difference between a **Master** and a **Beginner**,
    is that the **Master has failed** more than the **Beginner has ever tried**
